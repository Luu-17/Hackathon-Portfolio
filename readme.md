Lukhanyo Mzanywa Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio website! This site is a part of my hackathon project, where I showcase my skills as a web developer and designer. The website features a simple, sleek, and modern design with smooth transitions and animations.

What This Website Includes:
Home: An introduction to who I am and my goals as a developer.

Skills: A section detailing my beginner-level skills in Web Development, Photography, Graphic Design, MySQL, and Python.

Contact: A contact form for visitors to reach out, along with links to my social profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, and Facebook).

How It Works:
The site uses HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for simple animations.

When you load the page, it smoothly fades in from the right to make a sleek and modern first impression.

Each page has a clean background and minimal distractions, allowing users to focus on the content.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For page structure.

CSS: For styling and animations.

JavaScript: For the page fade-in effect.

This website is a work-in-progress and part of my journey as a developer. I created it to present my work, share my skills, and connect with like-minded individuals.
